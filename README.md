# Oasis Internship Repository 🌴

Welcome to my Oasis Internship repository! This repository contains the work I completed during my internship, where I performed three tasks related to machine learning and data analysis. 📈🔬

## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification 🌺
Folder: `task-1`

File: `iris-flower-classification.ipynb`

In this task, I worked on the Iris flower dataset to classify different species of Iris flowers using various machine learning algorithms. 🌸🌼🌺

## Task 2: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning 📧🕵️‍♀️
Folder: `task-2`

File: `email-spam-detection.ipynb`

In this task, I built a machine learning model to detect email spam, contributing to a safer and more efficient email experience. 🚫📩

## Task 3: Sales Prediction using Python 💰📊
Folder: `task-3`

File: `sales-prediction.ipynb`

In this task, I worked on a sales prediction project using Python, aiming to forecast sales based on advertising expenditure features such as TV, newspaper, and radio. 📈📰📻

## Setup Guide 🛠️
To set up and run the notebooks in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/I-AdityaGoyal/OIBSIP.git
```

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies and packages installed, such as Python, Jupyter Notebook, and necessary libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).

3. Navigate to each task's folder (`task-1`, `task-2`, `task-3`) and open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook file with the `.ipynb` extension.

4. Run the code cells to reproduce the analysis and results.

Feel free to explore and learn from the notebooks, and if you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out! 🤗

Happy learning! 🌟
